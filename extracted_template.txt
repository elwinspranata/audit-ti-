<IAD Internal Note: Auditors, like with the questionnaire, please choose between this page and the previous page, depending on whether you will use the generic rating definition or a specific rating definition to assign your overall rating.
Example: For the Problem Management audit, we would use the specific guidelines as follows:>

Legend For COBIT Management Guidelines Maturity Ratings

DS10 Manage Problems and Incidents

COBIT Maturity Ratings
0 - Non-Existent

Definition
There is no awareness of the need for managing problems and incidents. The problem-solving

process is informal and users and IT staff deal individually with problems on a case-by-case basis.

1 ­ Initial

The organization has recognized that there is a need to solve problems and evaluate incidents. Key

knowledgeable individuals provide some assistance with problems relating to their area of expertise

and responsibility. The information is not shared with others and solutions vary from one support

person to another, resulting in additional problem creation and loss of productive time, while

searching for answers. Management frequently changes the focus and direction of the operations and

technical support staff.

2 ­ Repeatable 3 ­ Defined 4 ­ Managed 5 ­ Optimized

There is a wide awareness of the need to manage IT related problems and incidents within both the business units and information services function. The resolution process has evolved to a point where a few key individuals are responsible for managing the problems and incidents occurring. Information is shared among staff; however, the process remains unstructured, informal and mostly reactive. The service level to the user community varies and is hampered by insufficient structured knowledge available to the problem solvers. Management reporting of incidents and analysis of problem creation is limited and informal. The need for an effective problem management system is accepted and evidenced by budgets for the staffing, training and support of response teams. Problem solving, escalation and resolution processes have been standardized, but are not sophisticated. Nonetheless, users have received clear communications on where and how to report on problems and incidents. The recording and tracking of problems and their resolutions is fragmented within the response team, using the available tools without centralization or analysis. Deviations from established norms or standards are likely to go undetected. The problem management process is understood at all levels within the organization. Responsibilities and ownership are clear and established. Methods and procedures are documented, communicated and measured for effectiveness. The majority of problems and incidents are identified, recorded, reported and analyzed for continuous improvement and are reported to stakeholders. Knowledge and expertise are cultivated, maintained and developed to higher levels as the function is viewed as an asset and major contributor to the achievement of IT objectives. The incident response capability is tested periodically. Problem and incident management is well integrated with interrelated processes, such as change, availability and configuration management, and assists customers in managing data, facilities and operations. The problem management process has evolved into a forward-looking and proactive one, contributing to the IT objectives. Problems are anticipated and may even be prevented. Knowledge is maintained, through regular contacts with vendors and experts, regarding patterns of past and future problems and incidents. The recording, reporting and analysis of problems and resolutions is automated and fully integrated with configuration data management. Most systems have been equipped with automatic detection and warning mechanism, which are continuously tracked and evaluated.
